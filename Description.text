Chore Tracker is a simple web application built with Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL that helps users manage and track household chores. Users can register, log in, and see a dashboard displaying all available chores along with their own personal list of jobs. They can add new chores by providing a title, description, and location, with validation ensuring meaningful input. Each chore can be viewed in detail, added to a personal list, edited, marked as done, or canceled if posted by the user. The application stores users, jobs, and user-job relationships in a MySQL database, enabling a full-stack experience with authentication, CRUD operations, and relational data management.

I will build it using:

Java and Spring Boot for the backend

MySQL for the database

Basic HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend
